# parse-keyval
Crazy simple Parse.com tabular data storage for IoT and friends

## How to use
I'll get right to it:

1. [Create a new Parse.com app.](https://www.parse.com/apps/new)
2. [Assign a hostname to the app.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okofish/parse-keyval/master/hostname.png)
3. [Clone the app to your computer.](https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#hosting/unix)
4. Replace the `cloud` folder in your app with the `cloud` folder from this repository.
5. Delete `public/index.html` in your app.
6. Run `parse deploy` in your app's directory.
7. Visit your app's hostname.
8. ***There is no step 8.***
